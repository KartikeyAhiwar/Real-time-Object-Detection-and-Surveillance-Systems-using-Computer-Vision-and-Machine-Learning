<!-- Replace with actual banner image link -->

Real-time Weapon Detection using Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms implemented with OpenCV.

This project implements a Weapon Detection System using Python and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect weapons in real-time video streams or images, making it a useful tool for enhancing security measures. The system processes input frames from a video source, detects possible weapons, and highlights them for further actions.

📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a Weapon Detection System using Python and OpenCV to detect weapons in real-time from video streams or images. The system highlights weapons in the video frames using bounding boxes.

🛠 Features
🎥 Real-time video stream processing to detect weapons.
🖼 Image processing using OpenCV for efficient object detection.
📈 Scalable for various security and surveillance applications.
